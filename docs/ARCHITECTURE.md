# Auth (Clerk):

Handles authentication for the users.
It connects directly to the FrontEnd (Next.js) for user login or sign-up flows.
FrontEnd likely retrieves user authentication tokens and sends them to the BackEnd for secure API interactions.

# FrontEnd (Next.js):

Acts as the user-facing layer where users interact with the application.
Communicates with the BackEnd (FastAPI) for retrieving and sending data.
Retrieves authentication data from Clerk.

# BackEnd (FastAPI):

Handles the core business logic and processes requests from the FrontEnd.
Interacts with external services like OpenAI API for AI processing and Pinecone for vector database operations.
Stores and retrieves data/files in AWS S3.

# Database (PostgreSQL):

This layer serves as the backbone for storing and managing application data. It is where the core business schema resides, and it plays a critical role in ensuring data consistency, reliability, and security.

# OpenAI API:

Provides AI capabilities (e.g., natural language processing, text generation).
Communicates exclusively with the BackEnd.

# Vector Database (Pinecone):

Stores embeddings or vectorized representations of data.
Likely used for advanced search, similarity queries, or AI model-related tasks.
Managed by the BackEnd.

# Storage (AWS S3):

Stores larger files or raw data that may not fit in the database.
Accessed by the BackEnd for read/write operations.
